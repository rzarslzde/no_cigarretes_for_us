# Quit Timer (GitHub Pages)

A tiny static site that shows how long it's been since you quit cigarettes — in **years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds** — reading the start date from `start-date.json`.

## Configure
1. Edit **start-date.json**:
   ```json
   { "start": "2023-02-14T09:30:00Z", "title": "Time since I quit cigarettes" }
